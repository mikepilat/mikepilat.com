I'm not a chemist, but I recently came across the blog of pharmaceutical
chemist Derek Lowe, and in particular, his serial feature called 
[Things I Won't Work With](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/things_i_wont_work_with/"). 
In it, he details with anecdotes, references and his own
superb wit various chemicals that, because they are extremely toxic, volatile,
or otherwise dangerous, he won't ever work with in the lab.  I encourage you to
read the posts, but I'll leave you with a few choice quotes that made me laugh:

On [dioxygen difluoride](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/02/23/things_i_wont_work_with_dioxygen_difluoride.php):

> Hydrogen sulfide, for example, reacts with four molecules of FOOF
> to give sulfur hexafluoride, 2 molecules of HF and four oxygens . . . and 433
> kcal, which is the kind of every-man-for-himself exotherm that you want to
> avoid at all cost. The sulfur chemistry of FOOF remains unexplored, so if you
> feel like whipping up a batch of Satan's kimchi, go right ahead.

For reference, [433 kcal (per mol) is the equivalent of almost a half-kilo of TNT](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=433+kcal&amp;a=UnitClash_*kcal.*KilocaloriesThermochemical--). Yikes.  

On [azidotetrazolate salts](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2009/01/07/things_i_wont_work_with_azidotetrazolate_salts.php):

> These Bavarian rowdies have prepared a series of salts of the
> unnerving azidotetrazolate anion. As they point out, the anion was described
> back in 1939 (in what I hope was a coincidental association with the outbreak
> of the Second World War), but its salts are “rarely described in the
> literature”. Yes indeed! People rarely spray hungry mountain lions with
> Worcestershire sauce, either, come to think of it.

On [chlorine trifluoride](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time.php):

> There’s a report from the early 1950s [...] of a one-ton spill of
> the stuff. It burned its way through a foot of concrete floor and chewed up
> another meter of sand and gravel beneath, completing a day that I'm sure no
> one involved ever forgot. That process, I should add, would necessarily have
> been accompanied by copious amounts of horribly toxic and corrosive
> by-products: it’s bad enough when your reagent ignites wet sand, but the
